# Camel K Kafka Quickstart

In this repository you will find examples about how to use `Camel K` with `Apache Kafka`. In particular we will show how to set up a Kafka Topic via Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka and be able to use in conjunction with `Camel K`. We have the following examples available:

* [Basic configuration from a producer/consumer `Integration`](./basic/) 
* [`Kamelet` source/sink configuration via `Service Binding`](./service-binding/)
